# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Console-Based C++ Application

A simple and interactive number guessing game developed in **C++**. This console-based game allows players to guess a randomly generated number, providing hints and tracking attempts until the correct guess is made.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Number Guessing Game** is designed to demonstrate the basics of user input, control flow, random number generation, and input validation in C++. It serves as a fun, beginner-friendly introduction to programming logic and condition-based interaction.

Built using simple C++ constructs, the project emphasizes **clean code**, **user feedback**, and **robust input handling** to ensure smooth gameplay.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Summary

- The system generates a **random number between 1 and 100**.
- The player repeatedly guesses the number, receiving hints:
  - `"Too high!"` if the guess is greater than the number.
  - `"Too low!"` if the guess is less than the number.
- The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
- The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✔️ Random number generation using `srand()` and `rand()`.
- ✔️ Input validation to handle non-numeric entries gracefully.
- ✔️ Real-time feedback with user-friendly hints.
- ✔️ Tracks and displays number of attempts taken.
- ✔️ Simple, clear, and easy-to-read console interface.
